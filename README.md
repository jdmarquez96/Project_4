# To work the python file, just run it from the command line (i.e. python3 Project4revised.py)

#If you want to change the masses, widths, and detector resolutions, open up the file and manually change the values. The values that can be changed are m0, s0, m1, s1, detector, Nmeas, Nexp.
#save any changes, and run the program to see the changes.
